# Low-contrast-roads
LC-Roads: a dataset for low-contrast road extraction.

We constructed LC-Roads based on the DeepGlobe dataset. <br>
For DeepGlobe, you can find the dataset at [DeepGlobe-CVPR2018](http://deepglobe.org/challenge.html). <br>
The related paper is at [here](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018_workshops/papers/w4/Demir_DeepGlobe_2018_A_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf). <br>
Thanks a lot for their great work!

For our LC-Roads, you can find it at [Baidu Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1gsIckLO9shqfAzznQizZKA?pwd=fcrd) (download code: fcrd), and Google Drive.
